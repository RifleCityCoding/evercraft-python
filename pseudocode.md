### Evercraft Pseudocoding

<details>
<summary>Project Requirements</summary>

[] Detailed pseudocode

[] Goal is to finish two iterations

[] Write tests, then write the code for those tests (MUST BE IN THIS ORDER)

[] Must comment our code well

<summary>Thoughts and Ideas for Project</summary>

- ### Iteration 1

    - Create a character -- How do we test for this? Maybe a test that returns true or false if user inputs a name? Build a code block asking user to input name for character

     - Feature alignment -- Still unsure on this one or how it would work..Maybe same true/false test for user input? Code being a user input asking to choose one

     - Armor class & Hit Points -- What kind of test and code block would we write for this? One that tests if hit maybe?

     - Character can attack -- Not rolling die, so set the stat based on a fixed 20 roll (Bro....He's one shot) How do we represent a roll, let alone fix it to roll only 20? 

     - Character can be damaged -- When user is hit we need a test and code block for when they get hit. Maybe an if statement for the code block, but how to test? Throw an if statement code block representing if you get hit remove X number of hit points, else block?

     - Character has Abilities Scores -- No idea..

     - Character ability modifiers / Modify attributes -- Still lost on how this works, maybe with the stats we roll on above, we are supposed to apply to our attack and defense phases?

     - A character can gain experience when attacking --  After each attack or monster death create code block that adds +10 to xp bar

     - A character can level -- After so many monsters defeated/swings level up. Lets set this lower at around 100? page recommends 1000 but we dont want to be demoing all day just to level up. Every time your character levels it has to add hit points and attack points to character...Maybe running a code block that has a true false value? If true level character, if false continue adding to xp pool.
